# Virtualenv without Command-Line

Simple setup scripts for Python 3 to both install virtualenv and create virtualenvs
without having to use the command-line.

The basic idea is to run pip_install_virtualenv.py to install virtualenv and run
create_virtualenv.py. This can be done however a user prefers to run python.
